                    <p class="card-excerpt">I went to Palma de Mallorca, Spain for a week with three other 
                        friends. We stayed at a friendâ€™s apartment and together we went out every day to discover
                         as many parts of this beautiful island as possible. The weather was perfect with sunshine 
                         and around 24 degrees every day, making it more enjoyable when exploring the island. The 
                         city of Palma de Mallorca is relatively small but there are countless and super exciting 
                         things to see such as unique buildings, cafes, stores, churches etc. My friends and I always 
                         tried to find local parts of the city to shop and eat to make our overall trip affordable. It 
                         never took too long to find local areas which had very economic prices and we were never disappointed 
                         by the food we were served. People in the city were super nice and smiled to us all the time, making 
                         the whole trip more comfortable and enjoyable. The city is also very exciting for young people which 
                         was clear to us when we went to the port on a Saturday night. Where was a long street with countless 
                         bars, cafes and clubs where many young people we having fun, listening to music and dancing together. 
                         This island is very known for its beautiful nature which we of course, also wanted to explore. So one 
                         of the days we went for a long walk where we saw The Castle of Bellver and many other historical buildings 
                         on the way. And we ended the walk by going to the beach to watch the sunset together. The island is also 
                         surrounded by many mountains which we decided to visit on the last day. We went hiking for the whole day 
                         which was very exhausting in the beginning, but was totally worth it when we reached the top of the mountain 
                         and were able to enjoy the incredible view over the whole island and the seaside. Overall I enjoyed every part 
                         of this trip and am very amused by the incredible things this island has to offer. And I would love to go back
                          one day to further explore Mallorca.
